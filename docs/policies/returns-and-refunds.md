# Acme Corp Returns and Refunds Policy

## Eligibility

Customers may return any unused product within 30 days of the original purchase date for a full refund. Products must be in their original packaging and in resalable condition. Digital products and gift cards are non-refundable.

## How to Initiate a Return

To start a return, customers should log into their Acme Corp account, navigate to Order History, and select "Request Return" next to the relevant item. Alternatively, customers may contact support at support@acmecorp.com or call 1-800-ACME-HELP.

## Refund Processing

Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after the returned item is received and inspected at our warehouse. Refunds are issued to the original payment method. Customers will receive an email confirmation once the refund has been processed.

## Damaged or Defective Products

If a product arrives damaged or defective, customers should contact support within 48 hours of delivery. Acme Corp will provide a prepaid return shipping label and issue a full refund or replacement at no additional cost. Photos of the damage may be requested for quality assurance purposes.

## Late Returns

Returns submitted after the 30-day window may be accepted at the discretion of customer support management. Late returns, if accepted, will receive store credit rather than a monetary refund. Store credit does not expire.

## Shipping Costs

Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the return is due to an Acme Corp error (wrong item shipped, defective product, etc.). Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless a prepaid label is provided.
