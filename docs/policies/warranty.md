# Acme Corp Product Warranty

## Standard Warranty

All Acme Corp products come with a 1-year limited warranty from the date of purchase. The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. The warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, accidents, unauthorized modifications, or normal wear and tear.

## Extended Warranty

Customers may purchase an extended warranty at the time of purchase or within 30 days of purchase. The extended warranty adds an additional 2 years of coverage (3 years total). Extended warranty pricing is 15% of the original product price.

## Warranty Claims

To file a warranty claim, customers must provide proof of purchase (order number or receipt) and a description of the defect. Claims can be submitted via the support portal or by emailing warranty@acmecorp.com. Acme Corp will respond to warranty claims within 3 business days.

## Warranty Resolution

If a warranty claim is approved, Acme Corp will, at its discretion, repair the product, replace it with the same or equivalent model, or issue a refund. Replacement products carry the remainder of the original warranty period.

## Exclusions

The warranty does not cover: consumable parts (batteries, filters), cosmetic damage (scratches, dents), damage from power surges or improper voltage, products purchased from unauthorized resellers, or products with removed or altered serial numbers.
