# Acme Corp Pricing and Promotions Policy

## Price Matching

Acme Corp offers a price match guarantee within 14 days of purchase. If a customer finds the same product at a lower price from an authorized retailer, Acme Corp will refund the difference. Price matching does not apply to clearance items, marketplace sellers, or auction sites.

## Promotional Codes

Promotional codes can be applied at checkout. Only one promotional code may be used per order. Promotional codes cannot be combined with other offers or discounts unless explicitly stated. Expired or invalid codes will not be honored.

## Loyalty Program

Acme Corp Rewards members earn 1 point per dollar spent. Points can be redeemed at a rate of 100 points = $5 discount. Points expire 12 months after the date they were earned. Membership is free and available to all registered customers.

## Sales and Discounts

Seasonal sales and promotions are announced via email and on the Acme Corp website. Sale prices are valid for the stated promotion period only. Acme Corp reserves the right to modify or cancel promotions at any time. Retroactive adjustments are not provided for items purchased before a sale begins.

## Pricing Errors

In the event of a pricing error, Acme Corp reserves the right to cancel orders placed at the incorrect price. Customers will be notified and offered the option to purchase at the correct price. If payment has been processed, a full refund will be issued.
